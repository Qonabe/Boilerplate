# What is it?

Simply put, this is a project aimed to:
- Accelerate the setup of a familiar dev environment on a new PC
- Make the creation of a new project a breeze

This is also some kind of a memo in case I forget something i've done weeks, months, or even years ago

# How to use it?

It should be pretty self explanatory.
- Each file in the `Environment Setup` should be self-sufficent
- Each file in `Project Creation` indicate the preliminary setups at the top, if there's any
